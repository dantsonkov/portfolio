        <h3>Trading212 - Invest platform</h3>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>The assignment was about building a new platform interface solely targeted at users wanting to invest long
            term. From manual investing to creating long term auto-investment plans, e.g. Retirement, Large purchases,
            Home improvements etc. Therefore the interface vastly differs/should branch out from the current
            CFD<a class="resume" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_for_difference">(Contract for
                difference)</a>-focused platform UI. The task is very complex and pivotal for the company‚Äôs
            future business targets/needs.</p>

            <figcaption class="fig-caption">Screenshot of the CFD focused interface</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The best thing about working on this project was the scale, variety of challenges and problems to solve: from
            UI iterations to crafting a long term, sustainable product. Also our team decided to start from scratch, so
            there is little to none legacy limitations be it design/code base wise.
        </p>
        <p class="note-strong">In this case study I will only be focusing on the 6 main tabs/pages, as I think that they
            show
            enough of the complexity and scale of the project, without being overbearing to the reader. üôå</p>
        <h4>Goals & challenges</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Define a clear main structure of the platform and its most impactful sections/tabs</li>
            <li>Salvage components that can be reused with no regards to the primary state of the trading platform, so
                that we can ship a useful, viable product in the shortest time possible.</li>
            <li>Create a clear & non-deceptive experience for users with a long term focus</li>
            <li>Limelight hundreds of educational videos made by us to help our users</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>User Research Results</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Users don‚Äôt tend to make sudden/rapid investments, but more planned and prefer thorough research before
                committing to a specific portfolio/instrument.</li>
            <li>Users find the CFD interface highly cluttered and busy for the purpose of investing</li>
            <li>Many of our features are hard to find, and there is a steep learning curve with the UI</li>
            <li>Dialogs from the CFD focused platform are clear and concise enough so that they can live in the new UI
                and can be reused, cutting down implementation times.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>1. Home</h4>
        <p>My main idea was keeping the UI as similar as possible to the old one since I didn‚Äôt want to introduce new
            complex mental models to the users. With that in mind, the platform needed a long-overdue visual update, so
            many of the components in our design system underwent a style refresh in line with our new brand guidelines,
            and respectively their new purpose.</p>
        <p class="note-strong">After discussing it with our head of design we concluded, that in our case a tabular like
            navigation is the most suitable.</p>
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="images" src="images/standard-view.png" alt="Default view of the home screen">
            <figcaption class="fig-caption">Default view of the home screen</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I opted to keep the position of the instrument list, with the now always-visible curated watchlists. On the
            right of it I positioned the details of the selected field. For me, the 3 column
            composition brings an understandable logical structure with rather easy navigation through the parent-child
            elements. The user will be able to scroll each column separately. We noticed a small downside to the
            structure, in which the user can lose context of the instrument they‚Äôre currently using. The solution was
            the introduction of a scrolled state of the Instrument details.</p>
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="images" src="images/standard-scrolled.png" alt="Scrolled state of the home screen">
            <figcaption class="fig-caption">Scrolled state of the home screen</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h4>Responsive design</h4>
        <p class="note-strong">A whole lot of whitespace</p>
        <p>The 3 column structure gave me freedom and simplicity in exploring the responsive breakpoints. The layout
            pretty
            much positioned itself around the screen, except for the sidebar. An interesting idea I wanted to try was
            detaching the sidebar and bringing the Advanced charting & Chat with us stack closer to the main navigation
            tabs, so that they don‚Äôt disappear at the bottom of the viewable area, with all the white space around them.
            The
            removal of the white background behind the sidebar lightened up the whole interface, in view to the
            additional
            screen estate.</p>
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="images" src="images/responsive-2560.png" alt="Responsive view of the platform">
            <figcaption class="fig-caption">Responsive view of the platform - 2560px</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="note-strong">A whole NOT of whitespace</p>
        <p>The minimal supported content width of the platform is 1000px, but that didn‚Äôt lead to any peculiar corner
            cases. The UI scaled down rather effortlessly, firstly the margins between the different components were
            going to be downsized to a minimum value, then the padding in the items and in some cases the typography
            also needed a little nudge. I won‚Äôt go into much detail as the product is localized in 11 languages, there
            are tons of corner cases concerning the typography and that is a whole ‚Äònother story‚Ä¶</p>
        <figure class="figure">
            <img class="images" src="images/responsive-1000.png" alt="Responsive view of the platform">
            <figcaption class="fig-caption">Responsive view of the scrolled Home screen - 1000px</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h4>2. Portfolio</h4>
        <p>Maybe the most crucial part of the whole project. Here the users have a clear overview of their whole
            portfolio. A historical performance graph, manual/recurring investments, funds allocation and so on. I
            neatly stacked these components on the left, and when selected their detailed views appear on the right. In
            the process of creating the new investment UI we created a Trading 212 Community forum and luckily several
            of the most wanted features were overlapping with what we had in mind. With more than 10k daily active
            users, the project put a lot of weight on my shoulders, and threads like that are very reassuring!</p>
