        <h3>Trading212 - Account history</h3>
        <h4>Task overview</h4>
        <p>Loads and loads of fields needed to be neatly displayed so that our users can easily navigate around their
            account history. The previous UI needed a long-overdue change, not only for better user experience but for
            tax purposes our users needed to extract certain pieces of information with ease. .</p>
        <h4>Obstacles</h4>
        <p>There were several obstacles to achieve a smooth experience, which I will try to summarise in a couple of
            bullets.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We wanted to ship the feature as soon as possible, as the user requests kept growing and growing.</li>
            <li>It was very important to make it as clutter free and as easy to use as possible, so that our users can
                do have a crystal clear overview of their account history.</li>
            <li>I‚Äôve started working on the new platform overhaul (Read more about it here), so I needed a flexible
                solution to the account history, so when the complete overhaul was finished I could easily migrate the
                feature.</li>
            <li>As I said earlier the task was time sensitive, so we didn‚Äôt have time for fancy stuff.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Plan of action</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>So I opted for a dialogue - I could easily avoid the then-current state of the platform without making a
                big sacrifice on user experience.</li>
            <li>Nested the appropriate fields to their corresponding parent element, so that I can lighten the initial
                cognitive load for users.</li>
            <li>With the parent-child hierarchy I made sub-items more prominent and clearly understandable.</li>
            <li>Added a floating element on the bottom which is tab-specific (on mobile) and shows the lifetime total
                for the 3 main key values:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Dividends</li>
                <li>Deposits</li>
                <li>Withdrawals</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
