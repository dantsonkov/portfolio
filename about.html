<h3>About me</h3>
<p>
  I'm an enthusiastic learner and am always seeking big and small ways to
  increase my knowledge and skills. One of my quirks is reading strange/unknown,
  useless facts on different topics. In my defence, they are great conversation
  starters!
</p>
<p>
  In my spare time, I enjoy having fun outdoors, hiking or exploring the streets
  of my hometown. When the weather doesnâ€™t cooperate, I enjoy reading a good
  book, lifting some weights or being a couch potato and playing some video
  games. ðŸŽ®
